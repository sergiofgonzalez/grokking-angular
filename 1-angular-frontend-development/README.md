> grokking the Angular framework for frontend development

This section explores how to create simple frontend apps using *vanilla* JavaScript in the browser. This means that we'll learn how to interact with the DOM without the help of 3rd party frameworks.

This section is based on the book Angular Development with TypeScript 2nd Edition, by Yakov Fain and Anton Moiseev.
