# Grokking Angular: Part 0 &mdash; Setting up shop: JavaScript in the browser   
> running *vanilla* JavaScript on the browser

This section explores how to create simple frontend apps using *vanilla* JavaScript in the browser. This means that we'll learn how to interact with the DOM without the help of 3rd party frameworks.

This section is based on the second part (chapters 13-19) of the book [*Eloquent JavaScript*](https://eloquentjavascript.net/), by Marijn Haverbeke.
